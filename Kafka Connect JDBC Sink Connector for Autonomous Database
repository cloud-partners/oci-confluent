# Kafka Connect JDBC Sink Connector for Oracle Autonomous Data Warehouse (ADW) or Autonomous Transaction Procesing (ATP) databases
You can use Kafka Connect JDBC Sink Connector to export data from Apache KafkaÂ® topics to Oracle Autonomous Databases (ADW/ATP) or Oracle database. This document covers exporting to ADW/ATP. 

The jdbc-sink connector comes pre-loaded with Confluent Kafka Community and Enterprise edition.  

# Secure Connection to ADW/ATP using Wallet
Connections to ATP/ADW are made over the public Internet. To secure any connection to ATP/ADW, it requires 
client applications to uses certificate authentication and Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). 
This ensures that there is no unauthorized access to the ADW/ATP and that communications between the client 
and server are fully encrypted and cannot be intercepted or altered.

Certification authentication uses an encrypted key stored in a wallet on both the client (where the application
is running) and the server (where your database service on the ATP/ADW is running). 
The key on the client must match the key on the server to make a connection. 
A wallet contains a collection of files, including the key and other information needed to 
connect to your database service in the ADW/ATP. 
All communications between the client and the server are encrypted.
